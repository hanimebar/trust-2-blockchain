Infosec - Henril Kärkkäinen
•	Henrik claims to know things but in fact he talks to people who know more than he does about things
•	Spent 10 years in a magazine called MikroBitti.  
•	Joined Sanoma news, he was a journalist in Digitoday, which ceased to exist (you can still find all the digitoday articles which is a departure from the way other papers/online news articles which is to erase or ‘throw them away’.  
•	They decided to solve the question : how to make news about IT that is interesting to my mother. Tabloid IT journalism
•	They started to write reports from gaming to testing phones to reviews. 
•	Typical journalism has a reverse pyramid that needs the following three requirements about "The Lead": and have a click bait or hook. "The Body": the main story, evidence, supporting info etc. and  "The Tail": which is like more context to the story.  
•	Infosec does it differently.  They simplify to what is this? How does it affect me?  What can I do about it?
•	So an example is that they reported on scammers and they would tell stories about it, like the old couple who lost their life´s worth of savings to scammers.  Infosec’s relevance is they will share these stories which typically don’t go through the main newspapers because of the potential shame that it can bring. 
•	They have a reach of 3 Mil.  They tell the story more than once to make sure that the message gets through especially if it can save people
•	Infosec does not believe in spinning a story (or to provide ‘alternative facts’).  Eg if the problem is a vulnerability in security, it’s not a malfunction.
•	Most of the news they get comes from tips from people.  So please contact them if you have a tip

•	We’re all in a war – in cognitive warfare. 6,5Bil $ invested by china to study how to manipulate the mind. 
•	West is behind
•	Sam’s job is to protect people from cognitive manipulation. 
•	Tiktok is one of the most invasive and even has different algorithms aimed at western users vs Chinese users.  The western users are driven towards addiction and ‘dumbing down’ (he didn’t use those words, I added those myself), but in China it guides their users towards productivity, screen breaks, exercise etc..
•	An operator looking to take control of or gain or manipulate a target needs to study the target well.  They select targets who have a good network which helps to get much information on them. 
•	The operator is interested in the private self; what we would never see in the public profiles.  How the target is ‘constructed’.  The best is to look at what people would hide like psychological state, sexual exploits and pleasures, disease etc.. 
•	There is slow profiling (to be proven or found like a hypothesis), and quick profiling (evidence-based, like what the person has, their skin, appearance etc.)
•	The things that can be used against the target cover all opposites characteristics
o	Care/harm 
o	Fairness/cheating 
o	Loyalty/betrayal 
o	Authority/subversion 
o	Sanctity/degradation 
o	Liberty/oppression
•	Gaming can be a very strong tool against a target – they give away a lot of info if the cognition is studied.  Especially if the person you are playing against is the one targeting you. 
•	They gain trust, and then surprise you when they attack. 

•	The Predator's speer is interaction and the spearhead is trust 
•	The key takeaways:
o	The key to survive is to exercised your metacognitive thinking – keep your eyes open, and pretend to be an operator who could take advantage. 
o	When a new person feels like an old friend, take a moment to think ‘there is no reason for this, what else could be going on here?’ 
•	The message is that we need to be aware that if we can’t be on the right side of heaven, we should at least try to be on the right side of hell.
